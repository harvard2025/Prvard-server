    <meta name="description" content="Prvard is an educational platform like Harvard that creates a virtual university experience. It’s called Prvard, a full-featured educational platform inspired by real university systems.Prvard allows users to create or join a virtual university that resembles well-known institutions like Harvard, Oxford, or Yale.The idea behind this platform is to solve a problem I personally experienced while learning online:Many online courses are isolated experiences. There is often no real community, no structured environment, and no easy way to connect with others who are learning the same material.Prvard transforms online learning into a social, structured, and interactive experience.Instead of learning alone, students become part of a real university-like environment — with classmates, communication, and collaboration.">
